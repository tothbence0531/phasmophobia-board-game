          in disrepair. Its planchette begins to move. <strong>“Y”</strong>.
          Your eyes widen. <strong>“E”</strong>. Your heart lurches.

        Lost In Cult, Phasmophobia: The Board Game brings the chilling terror of
        the video game to life. Equip your team with iconic gear and cursed

        adaptation plunges you into a world of suspense and survival. The terror
        has crossed over to your tabletop — will you rise to the challenge, or

        With design from Lost In Cult and artwork from illustrator Jamie Flack,
        the game’s meticulously-realised maps depict iconic properties from the
        video game with authenticity and careful attention to detail. Joined by
        carefully-crafted key items and tokens, all is entombed inside a reveal

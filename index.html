      <h1>How to play</h1>
      <i class="how-to-play__subtitle">
        Build a haunted property complete with foreboding rooms, full of
        unpredictable, randomised items. Then, draw a Ghost Type card from the
        Investigation File. Each Ghost has its own powers, paired with an
        evidence pool randomised for each playthrough, offering a terrifying
        challenge for even the most seasoned ghost hunters. Using the Ghost
        Behavior board the ghost’s actions become unpredictable, driven by
        abilities presenting ever-changing challenges that take a psychological
        toll. The threat escalates as your sanity deteriorates, giving way to
        more aggressive and dangerous manifestations. So make sure you prepare
        before heading inside: equip your team with the best ghost hunting
        equipment found in your Van. Venture into the residence to uncover
        cursed possessions and ghostly phenomena before, at last, arriving at
        the Ghost Room. Can your team conquer its surroundings and gather
        paranormal evidence before escaping?
      </i>
      <h2>House Assembly & Exploration</h2>
      <img src="assets/room_cards.webp" alt="Room cards" />
      <p>
        Using the instructional guide, construct the haunted property you wish
        to investigate. The provided layout and dimensions are merely a
        reference. Your team is encouraged to design its own unique or iconic
        floor plan to explore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Place the house contents (tokens) face down within the rooms of the
        property.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pick your investigators and vote for who will be your CI (Chief
        Investigator) for the mission. They will be in charge of displaying and
        controlling the Ghosts unpredictable behaviours, you can also play alone
        and control your own team if you dare.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the players search the property for clues to the ghost’s location,
        they may uncover the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blank: The room is empty - move on to the next location.</li>
        <li>
          Cursed Possession: Draw a card from the Cursed Possession Deck. These
          items can be equipped or traded among players for use during the
          mission.
        </li>
        <li>
          Skeleton Key: A single-use item that allows players to unlock and
          access sealed rooms during their investigation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hiding Spot: Once revealed, the token remains on the board. Rooms
          containing a Hiding Spot token serve as safe zones during a Hunt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hallucination Card: Draw from the Hallucination Deck and immediately
          apply the listed effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          Disturbed Items: When discovered, replace this token with a Ghost
          Token to mark the Ghost Room. From this point onward, the Chief
          Investigator rolls during the Ghost’s turn and consults the Ghost
          Behaviour Board to determine the Ghost’s actions for each round of
          gameplay.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Sanity:</h3>
      <img src="assets/ghost_event.webp" alt="ghost event" />
      <p>
        Just like in the original game, sanity plays a major role in influencing
        the behaviour of the paranormal entity haunting the location. As each
        round progresses, the team’s sanity gradually decreases - triggering
        more aggressive activity and making it increasingly difficult to gather
        evidence. The rate of this decline depends entirely on the team’s
        encounters and actions throughout the game. Darkness, Equipment,
        Hallucination Cards, and Cursed Possessions can alter this process,
        either accelerating or even temporarily restoring lost sanity.
      </p>
      <h2>Using Items & Identifying Evidence</h2>
      <img src="assets/room_tokens.webp" alt="room tokens" />
      <p>
        Once the Ghost Room has been discovered, the ghost token is placed on
        the board. Using the round order cards to determine the sequence of
        play, investigators begin utilising the Ghost Hunting Equipment stored
        in the Van to uncover the Evidence tokens shown on the Ghost Type card.
        The evidence is randomised at the start of each game, ensuring that no
        two investigations feel the same and keeping each session fresh and
        unpredictable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Players will engage with both the ghost and the environment inside the
        Ghost Room to uncover evidence. With the right equipment and a
        successful dice roll, the team can flip an Evidence token to determine
        if their investigation has yielded results. However, once the ghost has
        been discovered, it becomes an active participant in the round order.
        Guided by the Ghost Behaviour board, the entity will begin to interact
        with its surroundings, roam the map, and disrupt the investigators’
        progress. Time is critical - as the team’s sanity continues to decline,
        the ghost’s behaviour grows increasingly unpredictable and aggressive,
        escalating the risk of a Hunt.
      </p>
      <h2>Escape the Hunt, Flea the House & Win!</h2>
      <img src="assets/standees.webp" alt="ghost standee" />
      <p>
        Hunts can occur at any point during the game, triggered by the Ghost
        Behaviour board, Cursed Possessions, or Hallucination cards. When a Hunt
        begins, the Ghost standee materialises on the board and actively pursues
        the investigators, intent on eliminating them from play. Players can
        attempt to evade the Ghost by moving out of its range or hiding within a
        location that offers protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the investigation progresses, Hunts grow longer and more frequent,
        with the Ghost relentlessly stalking and cornering players throughout
        the property. Any investigator caught by the apparition is removed from
        the game. However, with the right possession, fallen teammates can be
        revived and brought back into play; without it, they remain lost. Once
        the final piece of evidence has been collected, the team must escape
        both the Ghost and the property to successfully complete the mission.
